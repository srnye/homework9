Final project - Javascript

# I will be using node.js to write/run javascript

# Steps to download node.js:
1. In the terminal, type 'sudo apt-get install -y nodejs'
2. Next, type 'sudo apt install nodejs-legacy'

# This project will also include using SCP2, to download SCP2 (I think I already took care of this step by adding the modules to the project but if it doesn't work, try the following):
1. In the terminal, type 'sudo apt install npm'
2. After npm is installed, type 'sudo npm install scp2 -g'

# This project is a javascript version of hw2

# The program will ask for the desired folder name, file name from icarus server, and icarus server credentials

# It will then attempt to retrieve specified file based on credentials

# It will inform the user if the SCP transaction was successful or not

# "Usage: node steven_nye_hw9.js [-c customerDataFolder] [-f dataFile] [-u userName] [-p userPass]"
